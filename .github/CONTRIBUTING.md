### Spell Checking

We are running [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rspec/blob/master/.github/workflows/codespell.yml) to check spelling and
[codespell](https://pypi.org/project/codespell/).
`codespell` is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and you can run it with:

```console
$ codespell --ignore-words=.codespellignore
```

### Linting YAML files

We are running [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) for linting YAML files. This is also run by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rspec/blob/master/.github/workflows/linting.yml).
`yamllint` is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and you can run it with:

## Creating new cops

- Document examples of good and bad code in your cop.
- Add an entry to `config/default.yml`. It's an ordered list, so be sure to insert at the appropriate place.
- Run `bundle exec rake`. This will verify that the build passes as well as generate documentation and ensure that `config/default.yml` is up to date (don't forget to commit the documentation).
- Add tests for as many use cases as you can think of. Always add tests for both bad code that should register an offense and good code that should not.
- Common pitfalls:
  - If your cop inspects code outside of an example, check for false positives when similarly named variables are used inside of the example.
  - If your cop inspects code inside of an example, check that it works when the example is empty (empty `describe`, `it`, etc.).
