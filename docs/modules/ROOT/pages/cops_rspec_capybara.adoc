Checks for consistent method usage in feature specs.

By default, the cop disables all Capybara-specific methods that have
the same native RSpec method (e.g. are just aliases). Some teams
however may prefer using some of the Capybara methods (like `feature`)
to make it obvious that the test uses Capybara, while still disable
the rest of the methods, like `given` (alias for `let`), `background`
(alias for `before`), etc. You can configure which of the methods to
be enabled by using the EnabledMethods configuration option.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
feature 'User logs in' do
  given(:user) { User.new }

  background do
    visit new_session_path
  end

  scenario 'with OAuth' do
    # ...
  end
end

# good
describe 'User logs in' do
  let(:user) { User.new }

  before do
    visit new_session_path
  end

  it 'with OAuth' do
    # ...
  end
end
